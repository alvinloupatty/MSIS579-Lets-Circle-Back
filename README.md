About

This project was developed to end the cycle of forgotten commitments and "Let's circle back" statements that never materialize. By leveraging AI to track and resurface important action items, we're helping teams follow through, make decisions that stick, and ultimately become more effective.

Overview
"Let's Circle Back" is an AI-powered solution that automatically detects, tracks, and resurfaces abandoned action items from meetings. Built to solve the common problem where over 40% of meeting action items are never followed up on, this tool ensures nothing falls through the cracks by persistently bringing unresolved tasks back to attention until they're completed.
The Problem

Research shows that when someone says "Let's revisit this later" or "Let's circle back to this," there's a high probability it will never happen. Our internal audits revealed that over 40% of action items from meetings are never followed up on, creating a vortex of unresolved tasks and decisions.
